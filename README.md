# A Python Bungee Jump

Intended to be an introduction to Python run in ~90 minutes. Interspersed
slides and work packet.

Overall I think this idea just didn't really work out. There are too many
context switches so that there's not nearly enough time to work through all
the material in 90 minutes; it would probably take closer to 2.5 hours, which
I think is just too much.

Plus the handout just has *way* too many words. People get overwhelmed trying
to read it all.

The second time I had to do a Python lesson a similar context, I ended up just
sitting down at a Jupyter notebook and working through some similar material.
Part of the context was that in our boot camp it ended up that the students
had already gotten exposure to some Python basics the previous day, so I
didn't need to start at the very beginning.

What can be salvaged? The handout is setup to have nice typography with inline
code listings, which could be useful for other handouts. Can't think of
anything that memorable in the slides, though I did like my “taxonomy of
errors” at the end.
